                <p>Addis Ababa (Amharic አዲስ አበባ, "new flower"; or Addis Abeba (the spelling used by the official Ethiopian Mapping Authority); Oromo: Finfinne "natural spring") is the capital and largest city of Ethiopia. It is the seat of the Ethiopian federal government. According to the 2007 population census, the city has a total population of 2,739,551 inhabitants.<br/>
			<br/><br/>
			As a chartered city (ras gez astedader), Addis Abeba has the status of both a city and a state. It is where the African Union is headquartered and where its predecessor the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was based. It also hosts the headquarters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), as well as various other continental and international organizations. Addis Ababa is therefore often referred to as "the political capital of Africa" for its historical, diplomatic and political significance for the continent.
			<br/><br/>
			Founded in the late 19th century by Emperor Menelik. Dubbed the Pentagon, the 30-hectare site incorporates a castle with 12 towers, along with 520 meters of stone walls measuring up to 5-meter high.
			<br/><br/>
			
			The city is divided into 10 boroughs, called subcities (Amharic: ክፍለ ከተማ, kifle ketema), and 99 wards (Amharic: ቀበሌ, kebele).

			PLACES TO VISIT 
			<br/>1- The Blue Nile Falls or Tis Abay (in Amharic) is about 35 km from Bahir Dar.
			<br/>2- Bahir Dar is situated on the southern shore of Lake Tana. On the islands in the lake there are some rural churches and monasteries. There are plenty of boat tours available to the monasteries; these range from 2 to 12 hours in length and can be booked through your hotel or by one of the many touts in the city. In some of these monasteries, women are not allowed to enter. Be cautious and aware of the traditions and rules of the Ethiopian Orthodox church when you visit. A boat is 950 Birrs for the 1/2 day trip. It's the official price for a boat, without guide services and without entrance fees. You decide what you want to see. 
			There are also long trips to the churches far away (3 hours by boat to reach them). The prices are much higher (3 times more).
			<br/>3- 
			Bahir Dar grew around a Jesuit settlement, founded in the sixteenth or seventeenth century, from which time the Pedro Páez building dates.
			<br/>4- One of Emperor Haile Selassie's palaces is located near the city, and the Emperor considered moving the national capital to the town. It is a rather small and ordinary italian built house with the lion of Juda in front of it. It lies at the end of an alley inside a park on top of a hill south east of the city.
			<br/>5- Lake Tana is not the source of the Blue Nile, it's before. The Blue Nile goes out of the lake up to Tis Abay (waterfall). If you take a boat trip ask the 'driver' to take you to the place where the river flows out of the lake.
			
			<br/>6- Every evening local boatsmen feed the pelicans in front of the lakeside "promenade" just before sunset. Reach this by following Giorgis St all the way through, it's close to the harbour. There is also a swimming restaurant. The whole setting is a nice opportunity to get lost between national tourists

Bahir Dar is the third largest city in Ethiopia, after Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, and has a population of 201,450. It is the capital of the Amhara region, inhabited by the Amhara people, the country's ethnically and geographically second largest group. The Ethiopian official language is Amharic.

Bahir Dar is a clean and well-maintained city by African city standards. It got somewhat popular with national tourists as also the lake and easy climate had made it even the emperor's choice for his summer residence. The result are numerous places to play pool, enjoy draft beer in garden style bars and have fresh fruit juices and the choice from big menus in plenty of cafés and restaurants.

Giorgis Road is the main road in north-south direction featuring plenty of shopping and restaurant opportunities. The bus station and markets lie in side roads to this one and anything close to it will allow you to explore the city on foot. Even the basic accommodations have neat, but basic services and often no wifi.

			PLACES TO VISIT 
			<br/>1- The Blue Nile Falls or Tis Abay (in Amharic) is about 35 km from Bahir Dar.
			<br/>2- Bahir Dar is situated on the southern shore of Lake Tana. On the islands in the lake there are some rural churches and monasteries. There are plenty of boat tours available to the monasteries; these range from 2 to 12 hours in length and can be booked through your hotel or by one of the many touts in the city. In some of these monasteries, women are not allowed to enter. Be cautious and aware of the traditions and rules of the Ethiopian Orthodox church when you visit. A boat is 950 Birrs for the 1/2 day trip. It's the official price for a boat, without guide services and without entrance fees. You decide what you want to see. 
			There are also long trips to the churches far away (3 hours by boat to reach them). The prices are much higher (3 times more).
			<br/>3- 
			Bahir Dar grew around a Jesuit settlement, founded in the sixteenth or seventeenth century, from which time the Pedro Páez building dates.
			<br/>4- One of Emperor Haile Selassie's palaces is located near the city, and the Emperor considered moving the national capital to the town. It is a rather small and ordinary italian built house with the lion of Juda in front of it. It lies at the end of an alley inside a park on top of a hill south east of the city.
			<br/>5- Lake Tana is not the source of the Blue Nile, it's before. The Blue Nile goes out of the lake up to Tis Abay (waterfall). If you take a boat trip ask the 'driver' to take you to the place where the river flows out of the lake.
			
			<br/>6- Every evening local boatsmen feed the pelicans in front of the lakeside "promenade" just before sunset. Reach this by following Giorgis St all the way through, it's close to the harbour. There is also a swimming restaurant. The whole setting is a nice opportunity to get lost between national tourists
